This project showcases a Vanilla JavaScript Project developed in under 3 hours. 

1. In this project we retrieve data about job postings from a remote JSON file using an API call.
2. Then we have built - A table based view to display the retrieved job postings.
3. Then we have built - Another view to display the list of candidates who have applied for a particular job posting.
4. Then we have built - functionality like sorting and filteration on the table.
5. Finally we have built - add, modify, delete functionality to add/modify/delete job postings.
